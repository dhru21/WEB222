# WEB222 Test 7: CSS (Week 8)

## Overview

In March 1722, the novelist Daniel Defoe wrote an account of the "Great Plague"
that happened in London during the year 1665.  His book was called
"A Journal of the Plague Year."

The file `index.html` includes the complete text of his book.  However, it has
no CSS styling, and needs to be improved to make it readable.

You will write a stylesheet and CSS rules to fix this based on what you learned
in Week 8.

## Instructions

1. Install the necessary dependencies using npm: `npm install`

2. Run the live web server using `npm start` and open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

3. Complete the list of CSS Requirements below.

You MAY consult the course notes to help you complete your work.

You MAY NOT collaborate with your peers.  All work must be your own.  Your
submission should not resemble any other student submissions.  The usual rules
of cheating and plagiarism apply, and your submission will be automatically
checked against all others.

When you are done, follow the Submission steps below.

## CSS Requirements

1. [1 mark] Create a file `styles.css` and include this stylesheet in `index.html`.

2. [6 marks] Choose three (3) different Google Web Fonts to use (pick fonts that work well together):
    1. the title text in the heading should use one San Serif based font
    2. all paragraphs within main should use a different Serif based font
    3. all pre elements in main should use a third Monospaced font
  - Include the necessary code to load and use these fonts.
  - Make sure you include default fonts in case the web fonts can't be loaded

3. [3 marks] Pick text and background colours to use:
    1. Pick one set of colours for the whole document.
    2. Pick different colours to use for the pre elements, so they stand out.
    3. Make sure your colour choices use good contrast so text is easy to read.

4. [4 marks] Improve the text's size and readability:
    1. Make the titles larger than the rest of the main text.
    1. Increase the size of the main text so it is larger
    2. Increase space between lines (e.g., 1.5, double, etc) for the paragraphs
    3. Indent the first line of every paragraph

5. [2 marks] Make one additional change not listed above to improve the document.

6. [2 marks] Make sure you include /* comments */ in your `styles.css` to explain what
each part of your file is doing, and how it relates to the requirements above (i.e., use the requirement number).

## Submission

Upload two things to Blackboard:

1. The completed `styles.css` file.  You can rename it `styles.txt` if Blackboard complains.

2. Screenshots of your browser showing your final styled document's titles, paragraphs, and pre elements.
